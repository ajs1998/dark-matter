    <p>Dark Matter color scheme for IntelliJ IDEA.</p>

    <p>
    The default "Dark" color scheme is a little disappointing.
    There's not enough color and too many tokens are white.
    This is my take on a dark color scheme.

        Not even God knows why you can't include the .xml extension here.
        As far as I can tell, this quirk isn't mentioned anywhere in the documentation.
        In fact, I can't find any helpful documentation for bundledColorScheme at all.
        I had to dig through other people's color scheme plugins to figure this out.
